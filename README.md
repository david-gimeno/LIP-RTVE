# LIP-RTVE: An Audiovisual Database for Continuous Spanish in the Wild
### Authors: David Gimeno-Gómez & Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos

The compiled audiovisual database is composed of around 13 hours of 
semi-automatically collected and annotated data. It is necessary to
mention that this database was primarily conceived at the first
instance as a corpus focused on the Automatic Lipreading or Visual
Speech Recognition task.

The LIP-RTVE was extracted from TV broadcast programmes contained
in a subset of the RTVE database¹ which has been employed in the
Albayzín evaluations². Concretely, despite the fact that this
database is made up of different programmes broadcast by Radio
Televisión Española (RTVE), we compiled our corpus only from the
news programme 20H.

### HOWEVER, THE LIP-RTVE DATABASE IS NOT AVAILABRE AT THE MOMENT.
In order to facilitate the use of our data in future reseach and
taking into account a Non-Disclouse Agreement (NSA) license, we are
processing the data to ensure a proper use of this database.
### THE LIP-RVTE DATABASE WILL BE PUBLICLY RELEASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

Thank you. We apologize for the inconvenience.
